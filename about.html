            About Us
        </h1>
        <p>At Pop! we want you to have fun with your food. We carry a variety of flavorful, fruity teas and smoothies and you can customize your drink with traditional boba or (our favorite) popping boba. Traditional boba is chewy and has a texture similar to a gummy bear. Popping boba is made of a thin gel-like coating filled with fruit-flavored juice. As the name implies, it pops in your mouth. Give it a try! Donâ€™t forget to bring your Pop! punch card. Your 10th drink is on us!</p>
